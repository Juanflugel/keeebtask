[![N|Solid](https://www.keeeb.com/img/favicon.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid) Challenge

To write the solution for this problem I used Angular js Framework and the following libraries

  >- guessLanguage.js for language detection
  >- underscore.js for handling collections and objects
  >- Bootstrap for some styling

Interface explanation:
  - There is one green botton that will show all languages detected in each group
  - then the green botton desapear and a blue botton apears, when this one is clicked will show the languages general view for the current page.
